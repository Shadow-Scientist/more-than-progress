# more-than-progress
Who said that progress bars should always be straight? anything that shows progress is nothing but a progress bar. Even a SVG vector can be used as an attractive progress bar. This is a simple concept of that.

Using 3 layers of SVG Path, we can create a progress indicator. We make use of stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to show the percent of progress and the marquee one. The rest of the part is controlled with a few lines of javascript. Also a dark mode switch was added, just for fun. :)
