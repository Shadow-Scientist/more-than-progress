# It's more than just progress!
Who said that progress bars should always be straight? anything that shows progress is nothing but a progress bar. Even a SVG vector can be used as an attractive progress bar. This is a simple concept of that.

## How it was created?
Using 3 layers of SVG Path, we can create a progress indicator. We make use of stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to show the percent of progress and the marquee one. The rest of the part is controlled with a few lines of javascript. Also a dark mode switch was added, just for fun. :)

## Where it can be used?
There is a couple of opportunities where we can use this concept. For example, if we build a code editor and a file as an input, is larger than expected so we can add this loader to indicate the file is processing. Another thing (that is funniest one!) it can be used for them who are currently learning Javascript and it could be their progress indicator, indicating how far they've learned so. :P
